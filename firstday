Prior to bootcamp I spent one year in a manufacturing facility.  I began as a Production Clerk and took a propmotion as a Quality Technician within six months.  I chose MAX bootcamp because I want to increase my employability and income as well as begin a new career in a fascinating field. I feel this is the fastest and most affordable way to do that!
